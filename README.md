# Highpine Reserve 🌲  
*A place above it all.*

Highpine Reserve is a fictional, fully responsive campground reservation website designed as a portfolio project. Built with modern frontend technologies, the project showcases a clean design system, accessible UI components, and a thoughtful user experience inspired by national park websites.

## 🧭 Overview

Highpine Reserve offers a polished front-end experience where users can:
- Browse the reserve and its features
- Explore available campsites
- View scenic imagery and site details
- Book a reservation (UI only — no backend)

The site is not connected to a real reservation system. It is intended as a demonstration of frontend engineering, design consistency, and component-based architecture using modern web tools.
